# Bachelor Thesis Results - Sofia Marcus & Vincent Lindvall
This repository contains the data from the results chapter of the bachelor thesis *Using Large Language Models to Generate Worked Examples in CS2* by Sofia Marcus and Vincent Lindvall.

The folder *Generated and Evaluated WEs* contains the worked examples (WEs) that were generated in this study along with their evaluations. The folder also contains graphs of the results shown in the thesis. The folder *Questions* contains the three CS2 questions (Q1, Q2, and Q3) that were used to generate the WEs. The modified versions of the questions were used for generating the WEs. The file ```generate WE.py``` contains the code used for generating the WEs through API calls to OpenAI's GPT-4 (you need a API key to run the code).

The evaluation method is heavily inspired by the paper [Evaluating LLM-generated Worked Examples in an Introductory Programming Course](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3636243.3636252) by Breanna Jury, Angela Lorusso, Juho Leinonen, Paul Denny, and Andrew Luxton-Reilly.

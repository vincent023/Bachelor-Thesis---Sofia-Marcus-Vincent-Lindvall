Overview: In this task, we will receive a list of integers, and a target sum. Our objective is to search for a pair of integers from that list which, when added together, equals the target sum. If no such pair can be found, our program will return None. If multiple pairs exist in the list that sum to the target, our code will only return one of those pairs. We are required to use a dictionary to optimize our solution for a time complexity of O(n).

We begin by initializing an empty dictionary. Then we'll iterate through the list, checking if the current number's complement (i.e., target sum - current number) is present in our dictionary. If it is, we'll have found a pair that sums up to the target. If it isn't, we'll insert the current number into our dictionary and proceed with the next number in the list.

STEP 1: Initialize the function and the dictionary
First, we will define our function and take in a list and a target sum as inputs. We then initialize our dictionary as an empty dictionary.

```python
def find_pair(numbers, target):
    complements = {}
```
    
STEP 2: Iterate over the list to populate the dictionary
In this step, we will iterate over the list of numbers. In each iteration, we will check if the complement of the current number exists in the dictionary. If it does, we return that pair of numbers immediately. If it doesn't, we add the current number as a key and its index as a value to the dictionary. This enables us to track which numbers have been seen.

```python
    for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
        complement = target - number
        if complement in complements:
            return [complement, number]
        complements[number] = i
```
    
STEP 3: Return None if no pair is found
After we have iterated over the entire list and haven't found a pair that adds up to the target sum, we return None. This signifies that no valid pair exists in the list.

```python
    return None
```
    
Complete code: Here is the complete function combining all the steps above:

```python
def find_pair(numbers, target):
    complements = {}
    for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
        complement = target - number
        if complement in complements:
            return [complement, number]
        complements[number] = i
    return None
```

This function will, in a single iteration over the list, find a pair of numbers that add to the target sum, or return None if no such pair exists. By using a dictionary to store previously seen numbers, we can check for complements efficiently, allowing for a time complexity of O(n).

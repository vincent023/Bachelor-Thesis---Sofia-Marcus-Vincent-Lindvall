Overview:
This problem involves iterating through a list of integers, finding pairs of integers that sum up to a specific target value. The problem specifically requires the solution to have a time complexity of O(n), which means the solution should avoid using nested loops that would lead to a higher time complexity. The key to achieving this is to use a Dictionary, which can store each integer as we iterate through the list along with the difference between the target sum and the current integer. By doing this, we can simply check if the current integer exists in the dictionary on each iteration. If it does, it means we have found a pair that sums up to the specific target value.

Let's break this down into steps.

STEP 1: Initialize your function and variables
Start by declaring a function that accepts a list of integers and a target sum as parameters. We'll call our function `find_pair_with_sum`. Additionally, we'll need a variable to hold our Dictionary. We'll call this `dict`.

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(int_list, target_sum):
    dict = {}
```

STEP 2: Use a for loop to iterate through the list of integers
For each integer in the list, we calculate the difference between the target sum and the current integer. If this difference already exists in `dict`, it means we've found a pair that sums up to the target value. If it doesn't, we add the current integer and the difference to `dict`.

```python
for i in int_list:
    difference = target_sum - i
    if difference in dict:
        return [difference, i]
    dict[i] = difference
```

STEP 3: Return None if no pair found
The function should return None if it completes the iteration without finding a pair.

```python
return None
```

Complete code:

```python
def find_pair_with_sum(int_list, target_sum):
    dict = {}

    for i in int_list:
        difference = target_sum - i
        if difference in dict:
            return [difference, i]
        dict[i] = difference
         
    return None

print(find_pair_with_sum([3, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 3, 6], 13)) # Expected output: [4, 9] or [7, 6]
```

The complete function `find_pair_with_sum` analyzes each integer in the input list, calculates the difference between the target sum and the integer, and checks if this difference already exists in the dictionary `dict`. If it does, the function immediately returns a list containing the difference and the integer, forming a pair that adds up to the target sum. If the function iterates over the entire input list without finding a pair, it returns None.

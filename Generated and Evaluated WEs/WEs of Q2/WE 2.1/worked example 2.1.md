Overview: In this task, we'll create a program in Python to find a pair of integers in a given list that add up to a specific target value. The program will receive two inputs: a list of integers and a target sum. It will iterate through the list, creating a dictionary to store integers that could potentially be part of a pair equaling the target sum. When a match is found, that pair is returned; if no match is found, it returns None.

This task requires knowledge of python lists and dictionaries, as well as control flow in Python (loops and conditionals).

STEP 1: Define the Function and Initialize the Dictionary
First we'll define our function `find_pair`, which will take two parameters: `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `target`, which is the sum we're trying to reach with a pair of numbers. We'll also initialize an empty dictionary, `used_numbers`, which we'll use to hold the difference between the target sum and each number we've already checked.

```python
def find_pair(numbers, target):
    used_numbers = {}
```

STEP 2: Iterate Over the List of Numbers
Next we will iterate over the list of numbers. For each number, we will calculate the difference between the target sum and the current number. If this difference is already in our `used_numbers` dictionary, we have found a pair that adds up to our target!

```python
for num in numbers:
    diff = target - num
    if diff in used_numbers:
        return [diff, num]
    else:
        used_numbers[num] = diff
```
In this step, `num` is each number in the `numbers` list. We check if the `diff` is in our `used_numbers` dictionary. If it is not, we store the `num` and its corresponding `diff` in the dictionary.

STEP 3: Return None if No Pair is Found
If we go through the whole list and don't find a pair that adds up to the target, we want to return None.

```python
return None
```

Complete code:

```python
def find_pair(numbers, target):
    used_numbers = {}
    for num in numbers:
        diff = target - num
        if diff in used_numbers:
            return [diff, num]
        else:
            used_numbers[num] = diff
    return None
```

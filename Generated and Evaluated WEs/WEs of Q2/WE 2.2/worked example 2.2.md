Overview:
The task is to write a Python program that can find a pair of integers in a list that sum up to a specific target value. The program should use a dictionary to achieve this with a time complexity of O(n). If there are multiple pairs that can sum up to the target value, only one pair should be returned. If no such pair exists within the input list, the program should return None.

STEP 1: Define the Function and Initialize a Dictionary
First, we will define a function named find_pairs that accepts a list of integers and a target integer as inputs. Inside this function, we will initialize an empty dictionary. This dictionary (let's call it elemDict) will be used to keep track of the elements we have seen so far in the list and their difference from the target sum.

```python
def find_pairs(int_list, target_sum):
    elemDict = {}
```

STEP 2: Iterate Over the List and Check for Pair
Next, we will iterate over the input list. For each element in the integer list, we calculate the difference between the target sum and the current element. We check if this difference is already in the dictionary. If it is, it means we have found a pair that sums up to the target. We return this pair as a list. If the difference is not in the dictionary, we add the current element to the dictionary and move to the next element in the list.

```python
    for i in int_list:
        difference = target_sum - i
        if difference in elemDict:
            return [difference, i]
        else:
            elemDict[i] = True
```

STEP 3: Return None if No Pair is Found
If the program iterates through the entire list and doesn't find any pair summing up to the target, the function should return None. This means that no pair in the list can sum up to the target sum.

```python
    return None
```

Complete code:

```python
def find_pairs(int_list, target_sum):
    elemDict = {}
    for i in int_list:
        difference = target_sum - i
        if difference in elemDict:
            return [difference, i]
        else:
            elemDict[i] = True
    return None
```

Now you can try running your function `find_pairs` with a list of integers and a target sum to check your function. For example, you can call `find_pairs([3, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 3, 6], 13)` to check if it correctly returns `[4, 9]` or `[6, 7]`. However, note that which pair it returns may depend on the order of the elements in the list as the function returns the first pair it finds that sums up to the target sum.

Overview:
In this exercise, we need to find a pair of numbers in a list which their sum equals a given target value. The Python program we'll write involves utilizing a Dictionary to store the integers in the list as keys and their respective indices as values. This way, we can decrease the time complexity to O(n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list, by effectively creating a lookup table.

Here's how we can approach this:

STEP 1: Define the Function
We are going to start by defining a function that accepts two arguments; a list of integers (nums) and a target integer (target). 

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
  ```
  
STEP 2: Initialize an empty dictionary
Within this function, start by initializing an empty dictionary. This dictionary will help hold our list of numbers as keys and their indices as values.

```python
    num_dict = {}
  ```
STEP 3: Create a loop to iterate through the list
Next, we'll create a loop that iterates through our list of numbers. For each iteration, we'll check if the result of the target minus the current number is in our dictionary. If it is, we've found a pair of numbers that add up to the target and we'll return them. If it's not, we add this number to our dictionary and continue to the next iteration.

```python
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target - num in num_dict:
            return [target - num, num]
        num_dict[num] = i
    return None
  ```
Complete Code:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_dict = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target - num in num_dict:
            return [target - num, num]
        num_dict[num] = i
    return None
```

This function will return a pair of integers that sum up to the target or None if such a pair does not exist. The time complexity of this function is O(n) as it only iterates through the list once and the operations within the loop have a constant time complexity.

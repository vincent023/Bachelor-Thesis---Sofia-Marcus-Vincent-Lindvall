## Overview:
In this problem, we're given an integer as input and the goal is to reach the number '1' in as few steps as possible. There are 4 operation conditions provided. The task here is to establish a predefined set of operations that should be used in order to reach to the number 1 from the provided integer. Our function needs to return the lowest possible number of steps it can take for the integer to reach 1. If there's no solution, it should return -1. We'll be using a recursive depth first search approach to arrive at the solution.

## STEP 1: Initialization
We start by writing a function called "steps_to_one", which takes in an integer parameter 'num'. Inside this function, we initialize a memoization dictionary to store the number of operations required to get 1 for each number.

```python
def steps_to_one(num):
    memo = {1: 0}  # memo is initialized with 1 and the operation count to get to 1 from 1 is 0
```

## STEP 2: Setting up Recursion
Next, we define a helper function called 'get_step' which acts as our recursive function. This will take an integer parameter 'n'. The base condition checks if 'n' is not in memo but is less than one, which means there's no way to reach to 1 so it returns float('inf') to consider this an infinite step. It then checks if 'n' is in memo to avoid unnecessary computations. Then, it will try to carry out each possible operation and choose the one that gives the minimum steps.

```python
def get_steps(n):
    if n not in memo and n < 1:  # if number is not in memo and less than one, there's no way to get to 1 
        return float('inf')
    if n in memo:  #  if n is in memo, return its value
        return memo[n]
    memo[n] = min(
        get_steps(n / 2 if n % 2 == 0 else float('inf')),
        get_steps(n - 20 if n % 7 == 0 else float('inf')),
        get_steps(n - 16 if n % 5 == 0 else float('inf')),
        get_steps(n - 7) # subtracting 7 is always allowed
    ) + 1  # plus 1 for the current step
```

## STEP 3: Wrapping it all up!
With the recursive helper function established, we are now ready to wrap it all up. We return the function call in the main function. We check if the returned value is infinity (indicating no possible sequence of operations), in which case we return -1.

```python
def steps_to_one(num):
    memo = {1: 0}
    def get_steps(n):
        if n not in memo and n < 1:
            return float('inf')
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        memo[n] = min(
            get_steps(n / 2 if n % 2 == 0 else float('inf')),
            get_steps(n - 20 if n % 7 == 0 else float('inf')),
            get_steps(n - 16 if n % 5 == 0 else float('inf')),
            get_steps(n - 7)
        ) + 1
    steps = get_steps(num)
    return -1 if steps == float('inf') else steps
```

So this is how we tackle this problem using a depth first search approach. Now, if you call, for example, the function with 70, it will output 4, which is the minimum number of steps to reach 1 using the given operations.

## Overview:
This task involves determining the minimum number of steps required to reduce a given number to 1 based on specified rules. The rules allow for the performance of operations depending on whether the number is divisible by 2, 5 or 7 or a constant subtraction of 7. This problem is a search problem where an optimal solution (least number of steps) needs to be found. Thus, weâ€™ll be using an algorithmic strategy known as 'depth-first search' (DFS) and apply recursion to achieve this. DFS is a common algorithm for traversing through a tree or graph, here we use it to systematically try out all possible combinations of the operations. The algorithm will keep track of the number of steps taken and return the minimum number of steps. The implementation will be done in Python.


## STEP 1: Creating the Main Function
Firstly, we need to create a function that accepts an integer as an input. This function will be the main function for our program and will call the recursive function that we will be creating later on.

```python
def min_steps(n):
    steps = recursive_steps(n, 0)
    return steps if steps != float('inf') else -1
```

## STEP 2: Creating the Recursive Function
At this step, we create the recursive function that performs the depth-first search. The function accepts two parameters - the number on which operations are to be performed, and count which keeps track of the number of operations performed. The base case of our recursion would be when n is less than 1. If n is exactly 1, we return the number of operations that led us here (i.e., count). However, if n is less than 1, we return infinity which indicates that the previous operation was not valid as it brought n below 1.

```python
def recursive_steps(n, count):
    if n < 1:
        return float('inf') if n != 1 else count
```

## STEP 3: Performing the Operations and Recursion
Next, we perform the four permissible operations and make recursive calls for each operation, keep incrementing the count, and ultimately, getting the minimum number of operations overall.

```python
    steps_a = float('inf') if n % 7 != 0 else recursive_steps(n - 20, count + 1)
    steps_b = float('inf') if n % 5 != 0 else recursive_steps(n - 16, count + 1)
    steps_c = float('inf') if n % 2 != 0 else recursive_steps(n / 2, count + 1)
    steps_d = recursive_steps(n - 7, count + 1)
    return min(steps_a, steps_b, steps_c, steps_d)
```

## Complete Code:


```python
def min_steps(n):
    steps = recursive_steps(n, 0)
    return steps if steps != float('inf') else -1


def recursive_steps(n, count):
    if n < 1:
        return float('inf') if n != 1 else count

    steps_a = float('inf') if n % 7 != 0 else recursive_steps(n - 20, count + 1)
    steps_b = float('inf') if n % 5 != 0 else recursive_steps(n - 16, count + 1)
    steps_c = float('inf') if n % 2 != 0 else recursive_steps(n / 2, count + 1)
    steps_d = recursive_steps(n - 7, count + 1)
    return min(steps_a, steps_b, steps_c, steps_d)
 ```

With this DFS approach, a solution will not be found for all inputs. For such cases, the program returns -1, signalling that it's not possible to reach 1 following the given rules.

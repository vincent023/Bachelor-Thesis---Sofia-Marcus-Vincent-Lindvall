## Overview 

In this task, we are asked to find a way to reach the number 1 from a given integer. The path to 1 can be found by performing one of the following operations in each step: 

- Subtract 20 if the number is divisible by 7 
- Subtract 16 if the number is divisible by 5 
- Halve the number if it is divisible by 2 
- Subtract 7 (this operation can always be performed regardless of the number) 

We want to accomplish the goal in the fewest number of steps possible, and if it's impossible to reach 1, the program should return -1. 

We will use Python to write a program that uses recursive depth-first search to solve this problem. 

## Step 1: Define the Recursion Function 

The base of our recursion will be when the input number (`n`) is already 1; in that case, we return 0 as no operations are needed. 

```python
def minimum_steps(n):
    if n == 1: # base case
        return 0
```

## Step 2: Explore all Operations

Next, we check each operation sequentially. It's important that we follow the conditions for each operation as stated in the problem. For each condition, we recursively dive into `minimum_steps()`, with the current `n` modified according to the condition. 

We will store these results in a list, which will allow us to compare all possible solutions and choose the best one. If a solution doesn't exist, we discard it by ignoring -1 results.

```python
    # Initialize results list
    results = [] 
    
    # Check each operation
    if n % 7 == 0:
        result = minimum_steps(n - 20)
        if result != -1:
            results.append(result) 
    if n % 5 == 0:
        result = minimum_steps(n - 16)
        if result != -1:
            results.append(result)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        result = minimum_steps(n // 2)
        if result != -1:
            results.append(result)
    
    # Subtract 7 operation
    result = minimum_steps(n - 7)
    if result != -1:
        results.append(result)
```

## Step 3: Choose the Best Solution and Increase Step Count 

Finally, we choose the best (minimum) step count from our results and increment it by 1 (since we have performed one operation). If our results list is empty (which means no solution exists), we simply return -1.

```python
    # Return the result (+1 for the current operation)
    if results:
        return min(results) + 1
    else:
        return -1
```

## Complete Code 

Here is the complete Python code for this task:

```python
def minimum_steps(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0

    results = [] 

    if n % 7 == 0:
        result = minimum_steps(n - 20)
        if result != -1:
            results.append(result) 
    if n % 5 == 0:
        result = minimum_steps(n - 16)
        if result != -1:
            results.append(result)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        result = minimum_steps(n // 2)
        if result != -1:
            results.append(result)
    
    result = minimum_steps(n - 7)
    if result != -1:
        results.append(result)

    # Return the result (+1 for the current operation)
    if results:
        return min(results) + 1
    else:
        return -1
```

NOTE: This problem can take a long time to solve if the input number is large because it involves repetitive checking due to recursion. If you observe that the computation takes too long, you may need to optimize the code using techniques such as memoization to decrease computation time.

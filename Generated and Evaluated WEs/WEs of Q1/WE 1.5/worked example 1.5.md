## Overview: ##

In this programming task, we are given an integer and we need to reach a target integer (which is 1) with specific operations and by taking as few steps as possible. The allowed operations are dictated by the divisibility of the current number: 

  * If the number is divisible by 7, we can subtract 20 
  * If the number is divisible by 5, we can subtract 16 
  * If the number is divisible by 2, we can halve it 
  * We can always choose to subtract 7

We need to create a program that will return the number of steps needed to reach the target of 1, using a recursive depth first search approach. If the task is impossible, the function should return -1.

**_Step 1: Implementation of 'DFS' function_**

Firstly, we need to create a function named 'DFS', which performs a depth-first search approach. In other words, it will explore all the possibilities of a specific operation before moving to the next operation. 

```python
def DFS(n, steps):
    if n == 1:
        return steps
    return min(
        DFS(n - 1, steps + 1) if n - 1 >= 1 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n - 7, steps + 1) if n - 7 >= 1 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n // 2, steps + 1) if n % 2 == 0 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n - 16, steps + 1) if n % 5 == 0 and n - 16 >= 1 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n - 20, steps + 1) if n % 7 == 0 and n - 20 >= 1 else float('inf')
    )
```  

**_Step 2: Implementation of main function_**

We then write a function named 'min_steps', that contains a call to 'DFS' function. If a solution is found, return the number of steps. If not, return -1. 

```python
def min_steps(N):
    steps = DFS(N, 0)
    return steps if steps != float('inf') else -1
```  
**_Step 3: Testing_**

Finally, we'll do a quick test to check that the program is working as intended.

```python
# Testing
print(min_steps(70))  # Expected output: 4
print(min_steps(623))  # Expected output: 9
```  

## Complete Code: ##

```python
def DFS(n, steps):
    if n == 1:
        return steps
    return min(
        DFS(n - 1, steps + 1) if n - 1 >= 1 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n - 7, steps + 1) if n - 7 >= 1 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n // 2, steps + 1) if n % 2 == 0 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n - 16, steps + 1) if n % 5 == 0 and n - 16 >= 1 else float('inf'),
        DFS(n - 20, steps + 1) if n % 7 == 0 and n - 20 >= 1 else float('inf')
    )

def min_steps(N):
    steps = DFS(N, 0)
    return steps if steps != float('inf') else -1

# Testing
print(min_steps(70))  # Expected output: 4
print(min_steps(623))  # Expected output: 9
```

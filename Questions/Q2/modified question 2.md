Given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a specific value. For example, for the list: {3, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 3, 6} and the sum 13, one can find (4, 9) or (6, 7). Write a program that takes a list of integers and a target sum, and returns a list with one of the pairs that has the correct sum. If there are multiple pairs, it should find only one. If there are no pairs with the correct sum, it should return None. The program should solve the task in O(n) time complexity. Use a Dictionary.
